# Editorial policy

The rules this repository is built and maintained by. The README's
"How tools are selected" section is the short version; this is the full one.

## Scope

Tools used to do research: web and academic search, deep research agents, paper discovery,
document reading, evidence synthesis, reference management, knowledge organisation, data
analysis, market and competitive research, user research, fact checking, and the APIs that
make those available programmatically.

Two scope rules do most of the work.

**A general chatbot is not a research tool.** A model answering from memory is not doing
research. A general assistant is listed only where it ships a distinct multi-step research
mode that browses and returns a sourced report, and it is listed in that category rather than
alongside search engines.

**Scholarly infrastructure counts.** OpenAlex, Crossref, Unpaywall, and PubMed are not AI
products, and leaving them out would make the list less useful, not purer. They are what the
AI layer queries. They are grouped separately so a reader can tell the difference.

## What qualifies

- It materially helps with finding, reading, synthesising, organising, or verifying research.
- The research capability is the product, not a feature added to something else.
- Any claim about citations, source grounding, or corpus coverage is documented by the vendor.
- There is enough public information to describe it accurately.
- It covers something the entries already in that category do not.

## What does not

- General chatbots with no distinct research mode.
- Products whose research claim is an adjective on the homepage and nothing more.
- Essay mills, paper writers, and anything sold as a way to avoid reading.
- AI-content detectors, which are not reliable enough to list as verification tools.
- Broken, parked, or login-walled sites with no public information.
- Products that have shut down or been folded into something else.
- Affiliate landing pages, coupon sites, and lead-capture funnels.
- Near-identical clones with no meaningful difference from something already listed.
- Anything whose main activity is clearly illegal, and NSFW-focused products.
- Anything submitted purely as a promotional exercise.

## Descriptions

One sentence, 8 to 25 words, 35 at the absolute maximum, ending in a full stop. Written for
this repository rather than adapted from a vendor's homepage, and rewritten if a neighbouring
entry could swap places with it unnoticed.

Banned outright: superlatives (*best*, *leading*, *revolutionary*, *cutting-edge*,
*game-changing*, *world-class*, *ultimate*, *powerful*, *seamless*, *unleash*), `AI-powered`
as an opening, unverifiable claims about users, funding, or awards, and the em dash inside a
description, which is reserved as the entry separator so the format stays machine-parseable.

## Metadata vocabularies

Closed sets. A term outside them is a defect, not a judgement call.

**Pricing** — at least one, at most two, in this order:
`Free` · `Freemium` · `Paid` · `Open Source` · `Free Trial`

`Open Source` means an OSI-approved licence. Source-available products do not get the label;
the description says "source-available" instead. `Free Trial` never appears alone.

**Platform** — zero to six, in this order:
`Web` · `Windows` · `macOS` · `Linux` · `iOS` · `Android` · `API` · `CLI` ·
`Browser Extension` · `VS Code` · `JetBrains` · `Discord`

Applied only where verified. A wrong label is worse than a missing one.



## Ordering

Alphabetical within a category, ignoring punctuation and a leading "The". Position carries no
meaning and there is no paid placement.

Between categories, the order is editorial, by expected reader interest. That ranks topics,
never products.

## Categories

Minimum 4 entries, 8 is the working target, roughly 15 is the ceiling. A category that cannot
reach 8 strong entries is merged or dropped rather than padded. No subcategories.

The taxonomy is revisited when a category drops below 6 entries, passes 15, or starts
receiving the same submissions as its neighbour.

## Links

The primary link is the resource's own official site: canonical, HTTPS, no tracking
parameters, no affiliate parameters, no shortener, no directory listing, no review page.

TiorAI links are capped: at most 25% of entries carry one, all distinct, at most three per
category, maintainer-placed only. Contributors are asked not to add them.

## Removal

An entry is removed when the product shuts down, the domain is taken over or starts serving
something harmful, the listing turns out to be misleading, or the entry no longer meets the
scope above. Removals are recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md). An entry removed for
a safety reason goes through review again rather than being quietly restored.
